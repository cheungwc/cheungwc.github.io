Hi! I am currently an assistant professor at the Departemnt of [Industrial Systems Engineering & Management](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/isem/), the National University of Singapore. Previously, I received my PhD in Operations Research from the [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, supervised by [Prof David Simchi-Levi](https://slevi1.mit.edu/). 

My research interests are online learning and resource allocation, which lie in the intersection of Operations Research and Machine Learning. See **Selected Works** below, and [Research Interest](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03024) for some descriptions.
